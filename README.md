## Summary
The purpose of this project is to understand jQuery, a popular client-side tool that is used for creating websites with less work and code.

jQuery was used for the fundemental design of the website, as well as for client-side validation. There is no backend to this website, as that was not the goal. Validation is proven with a text area that outputs everything the user inputted underneath the widget.

Additionally, this website includes multiple widgets (checklists, calanders, rangess, etc.) that can be used for future projects. The CSS/HTML of this project is highly reusable for future projects.
